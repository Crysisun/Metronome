# Metronome
This is a simple metronome for me to get familiar with the React.
## Getting Started
I used the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to initialize this app.
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the Node.js installed, after you install the Node, NPM will also be included.
### Clone 
```
git clone 
```
