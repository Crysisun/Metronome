# Metronome
This is a simple metronome for me to get familiar with the React.
## Getting Started
I used the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to initialize this app.

git clone https://github.com/Crysisun/Metronome.git
```
### Run the app
```
cd metronome
npm start
```
* Open the client at http://localhost:3000/
## Built with
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
